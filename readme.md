# Pick-n-Pull Tool

This is just a scratch project to help search and filter available cars near me.

`knownUrls.json` contains an array of URLs for cars to ignore when printing out what's new. It needs to be manually updated.

**My 1995 Honda Del Sol Si 5 speed manual needs a new ECU!**

The fuel pump won't prime because of what I suspect is a transistor failure. I'll try to repair that too.

The Honda part number is "37820-P28-A02". If you have one you would like to donate to the cause, please contact me via twitter.
